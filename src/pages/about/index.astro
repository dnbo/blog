			<h2>Who am I?</h2>
			<p>
				ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel â€” a full-stack developer with a strong focus on Angular and modern web
				technologies. Over the years Iâ€™ve worked in both product and consulting roles, including
				leading development at my own successful startup.
				<br />
				<br /> I enjoy building clean, scalable solutions and helping teams grow â€” not just by shipping
				code, but by improving developer experience, processes, and collaboration. My background in consulting
				has given me the chance to adapt quickly, deliver value in different domains, and mentor teams
				to succeed. <br />
				<br />This blog is where I share notes, learnings, and experiments from my day-to-day work â€”
				part knowledge base for myself, or for anyone looking for solutions to specific problems, or
				is just curious about how I approach software engineering.
